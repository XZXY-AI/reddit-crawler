    "标题": "TikTok / ByteDance Hiring 2025: Yes, We’re Still Hiring! 🚀",
    "正文": "Despite the rumors of a US ban, TikTok and ByteDance are actively hiring across various teams globally! Did you know ByteDance is the most valuable privately held company in the world? If you’re looking for an exciting opportunity, now’s your chance.\n\n🔗 Referral Links (Your Application Will Show Up as a Referral!):\n* TikTok: https://careers.tiktok.com/s/iywjFmNj\n* Bytedance: https://job.toutiao.com/s/iywjhNrY\n\nSimply use these links to apply, and your application will be marked as a referral—giving it a better chance of being reviewed by a recruiter!\n\nKey Details:\n* Roles are typically in-office 3x a week (some teams may require 5x); fully remote positions are not available.\n* Visa support is generally available for mid-level roles and above. Check Levels.fyi for insights on leveling.\n* If links aren’t accessible (e.g., you’re based in India), use a VPN and private browser.\n\nApplication Guidelines:\n* No limit to the number of applications, but I recommend focusing on a maximum of 8 roles.\n* Monitor your application status via the career sites (desktop). Email updates for rejections are rare.\n* I cannot track your application status or contact recruiters/hiring managers for you, but if you’re contacted by a recruiter, please let me know!\n\nTips for Referrals:\n* Referrals don’t guarantee an interview but ensure your resume gets reviewed by a recruiter.\n* Use the referral links above for new applications only (they can’t be added to previously submitted applications).\n* Resume reviews may take anywhere from a few days to a few weeks, so be patient!\n\nCampus/Internship Roles ONLY:\n* Limit your applications to 2 roles.\n* Apply directly on the career site and use referral code: XZ1M9FN\n\nFeel free to share this post with anyone who might be interested. Let me know any questions! 🚀",

    "正文": "Does anyone know if ML will be banned in the U.S. on January 19th alongside the other BiteDance (TikeTok, Lemon8, CapCut, etc.) apps?\n\nFrom what I read on the internet, ML's parent company is still ByteDance ever since they acquired Moontoon, and with the way things are going right now here in the U.S., ByteDance is likely going to get banned. So I hope someone can tell me whether I am overreacting with ML's possible ban here since I haven't seen anyone talking about it.\n\nI've done my fair bit of research on the internet and I have only seen people talk about it being a \"TikTok\" only ban when it, in actuality, is a \"ByteDance\" ban.\n\nI have also spent quite a few years (3 years) playing this game and have put a decent amount of money into it too just for the game to get banned where I live. \n\nIf someone knows anything about this, I'd greatly appreciate any insight.

Was predominantly women and comparatively high quality content，since yesterday it's just Yank TikTok crap. \n\nThe workers at the platform must be going spare trying to deal with the sudden change.",
